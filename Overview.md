##Food Statistics Pocketbook Summary

This summary provides a selection of information from the full Food Statistics Pocketbook covering the economic, social and environmental aspects of the food we eat. It contains statistics for different time periods, but always using latest available data at the time of release.
Data comes from surveys run by Defra and the Office for National Statistics and from a wide range of other sources including government departments, agencies and commercial organisations.  
The full publication is available here: 
[Food statistics pocketbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/food-statistics-pocketbook)

Associated datasets from this year’s publication are also available.
Data are a mixture of National Statistics, Official Statistics and unofficial statistics. Unofficial statistics are used where there are gaps in the evidence base. Where National Statistics (Official Statistics that comply with the national statistics code of practice) are used this is indicated.
Further information on National Statistics can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.

## Origins of food consumed in the UK, 2016

Region            |Percentage supplied to the UK
-|-
UK<sup>a</sup>    |49%|
EU 	          |30%|
Africa            |5%|
North America     |4%|
South America     |4%|
Asia      	  |4%|
Rest of Europe	  |2%|
Australasia	  |1%|
{barchart}

(a) UK origin consists of UK domestic production minus UK exports

Sourcing food from a diverse range of stable regions, in addition to domestically, enhances food security<sup>5</sup>.
Based on the farm-gate value of unprocessed food in 2016<sup>6</sup>, the UK supplied just under half (49%) of the food consumed in the UK. The leading foreign supplier of food consumed in the UK were countries from the EU (30%). Africa supplied 5%, Asia, North and South America all provided a 4% share of the food consumed in the UK.
The three largest value imported commodity groups (at 2016 prices) were fruit & vegetables, meat and beverages (see 3.4).

###Economic Definition of food and agri-food sector

The UK food sector is defined as food manufacturing, food wholesaling, food retailing and non- residential catering.  In terms of the standard industrial classification (SIC 2007) it is defined as:

Category                  | SIC codes
-|-
Food Manufacturing:       | 10 + 11 |
Food Wholesaling:         | 46.3 (excluding 46.35) + 46.17 |
Food Retailing:           | 47.2 (excluding 47.26) + 47.11 + 47.81 | 
Non-residential Catering: | 56 |

The deductions are to remove non-food items as far as possible.

The agri-food sector is the food sector plus agriculture and fishing. Agriculture and fishing are shown in several charts for comparison.

###Net capital expenditure
This is calculated by adding to the value of new building work, acquisitions less disposals of land and existing buildings, vehicles and plant and machinery.

###Gross Value Added (GVA)
GVA is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given sector / industry. This is the difference between the value of goods and services produced and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production.

###Total Factor Productivity (TFP)
Productivity measures the efficiency at which inputs are converted into outputs. Total Factor Productivity provides a comprehensive picture of growth.

###Low income
The most commonly used threshold to determine relative low income is having an income which is less than 60% of the median in that year.
Absolute low income is considered to be having an income which is less than 60% of the median in that year, adjusted by inflation.

###Equivalised income
The income a household needs to attain a given standard of living will depend on its size and composition. Equivalisation is a means of adjusting a household’s income for size and composition so that the incomes of all households are on a comparable basis.

###Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
Outside of these statistics, the definition of a SME can depend upon several factors, including turnover. For these statistics, a ‘small’ business is a private sector business with fewer than 50 employees. A ‘medium’ business is a private sector business with between 50 and 249 employees.
A ‘micro’ business is a private sector business with between 1 and 10 employees, which, for the purpose of these statistics is incorporated within the ‘small’ category.
